## Steps for setup
1. In the `pom.xml` file go to `<remote.server>https://cphper.dk/manager/text</remote.server>`. Change to your own droplet.
2. Go to workbench and make your database. I have a table for my production and one for testing.
3. In the `persistence.xml` on line 21 and 35, change `Ca3_boilerPlate` and `Ca3_boilerPlate_test` to point at your own database and test database.
4. Go to `EMF_Creator.java`. Change line 43 and 46 to point at your CONNECTION_STR name on your vitual machine. (Can be found on my virtual machine under docker-compose.yml)
5. Clean and build the project and then run the file SetupTestUsers. This is to populate the production database before migrating it to my virtual machine.
6. Migrate the local table to the online table on your virtual machine.
7. Time to setup travis. Go to `https://travis-ci.com/` and connect to your github account. Now give travis access to your repository on github so that travis can deploy your war file for you after each successful build. Remember to add user and password for your virtual machine since travis can't deploy without this. I've saved mine as environmental variables on my virtual machine.
